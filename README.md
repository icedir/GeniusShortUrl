What is GeniusShortUrl?
---

GeniusShortUrl is an open source **reactive service** that converts long links to short links based on **SpringBoot Webflux**, which can quickly respond to link conversions and jumps.

- __Blazing Performance__

GeniusShortUrl is developed based on SpringBoot Webflux and can naturally receive more concurrent requests. And the project uses Caffeine cache, when the behavior of hitting the cache occurs, the response is extremely efficient.

- __Easy To Use__

GeniusShortUrl only needs very simple configuration, such as mysql database connection and cache configuration to run, which is easy to start quickly.

- __Tiny Size__

GeniusShortUrl is only about 39MB after packaging, and there is room for further optimization, which is also very friendly to memory usage.
